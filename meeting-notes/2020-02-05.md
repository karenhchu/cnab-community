    - security spec drafts merged into `master` ðŸ˜Ž - feedback welcome

- [spec issue #319](https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-spec/issues/319) - Standardize spec version layout and use versioning per described process
- CNAB Core 1.0.1 discussion (and possible vote)
    - Do we hold until this is fixed? https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-spec/issues/316

### Notes

- Introductions (again)
    - Nuno
- Carolyn demos Porter
    - saving host environment remotely and injecting secrets from Azure Key Vault
    - Porter and `cnab-go` changes required to make this work
    - Radu: How difficult is it to add a different source for storage and secrets?
    - in Go it is pretty simple, used quickstarts for various clouds
    - the CRUD store interfaces are already defined in `cnab-go`, so in Go you have to implement the interfaces to read/write to/from your source
    - ideally, we could work the plugins  generically enough so any CNAB implementation would use them
    - for other languages, implement RPC (not gRPC) - look into examples from Hashcorp plugin-go - make a binary / executable that implements the Go RPC interface
    - Matt Butcher: are plugins long-running? (external plugins)
    - Carolyn: no, there is a connection that is closed after the one operation is performed, but you can manually specify the connection to be kept open
    - Butcher: are there any concurrency issues if you are running multiple Porter instances that read/write to the same store (storage container)?
    - Carolyn: you do have to have something that is capable of acquiring a lock on a given resource so you don't concurrently try to change the same resource
    
    - Jacob: there is an opportunity to add X providers (secrets, paramters) into `cnab-go` so implementations could retrieve them directly from `cnab-go`
    - Carolyn: next step is to use the same model for paramters
    - Jacob - do we need a separate interface for retrieving paramters? (more complex validations, for example)
    - Ralph: let's create some concrete user stories to really understand how much more complex the paramter validations are for this scenario
    - Carolyn: since we have this issue both in Porter and at DataDog, I think this is a real problem
    - Jacob: I already have an interface for this, I could share it and see if it needs any modifications
    - Carolyn: Great, share it!
    - Jacob: it makes sense to have interfaces for getting credentials, paramters, claims. There is an issue with the driver interface where if you instantiate multiple driver instances, the driver has to recreate the claim from the operation object, which might need refactoring. Right now I have an API that is backed by the Kubernetes driver, so I have to reconstruct the claim on the API before talking to the actual Kubernetes driver implementation

- Moving `cnab-to-oci` to `cnabio`
    - Silvin: yesterday we transferred the ownership of `cnab-to-oci` from Docker to `cnabio`. We asked JDF the requirements - only a few commits that were not signed off, we added a DCO bot to the repository.
    - Matt Butcher: great news! 
    - Radu: we want to move `signy` as well
    - Butcher: also ask Chris Chrone

- Possible vote for CNAB Core 1.0.1
    - there is one issue (316) that could result in uncertainty
    - we should hold off on voting until after this issue is resolved

- issue 319
    - 3 parts to the request
        - explain how the documents in the spec repo relate to each other
        - bring the state of the files in the repo up to date with ^^
        - standardize the way we represent versions
    
    - Ralph: the context is that a larger org is looking into understanding the spec, and they don't
    - Matt: even formatting change will have to be formalized

- next week
    - more interfaces into cnab-go and other language libraries
    - hopefully call a vote for core
