### Notes

- CNAB 1.0.1 is ready to be released (Matt)
    - Subminor/patch releases only include minor fixes and clarifications
    - [PR](https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-spec/pull/335) has been LGTM'd by all maintainers and CNAB project leads so is validated
    - We will merge the PR after this meeting
- [Spec PR #339](https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-spec/pull/339) (Carolyn)
    - Claims specification is actively being worked on so that tools are interoperable
    - Separation of claims and outputs as outputs can be big
    - Shuffle around fields so that we don't need to store all outputs as part of the claim
    - Chris would be for merging this and asking for improvements
        - 400 part of the spec is unstable so fine to merge and ask for improvements
- [Spec PR #340](https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-spec/pull/340)
    - Clarify pending state
    - Add running state to indicate when the invocation image is currently running
        - Make visible that there is an operation in progress
    - Jacob would like that we standardize on noun/verb and suggests we add a cancel state
- [Community PR 24](https://github.com/cnabio/community/pull/24)
    - Adds common documents to community repo: contributing guide and governance
    - Ready to merge and will follow up with PR to match what we say with what we do
    - Unclear who owns repo
        - Chris thinks anyone should be able to contribute except on some files
        - Carolyn will put up PR
- Working document for CNAB Registries
    - Chris: we have a structure in place - anyone who wants to contribute is invited to, Chris will start to document how `cnab-to-oci` works right now
    - Chris: do we have a process of ratifying other specs?
    - Matt: we have the same process as for the core spec, vote has to be unanimous.
    - Chris: it may be worth having external people review the security document (Justin Cormack)
- Jacob's work on [#285](https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-spec/issues/285)
    - Please take a look at these!
    - Show complexity of making bundle internals visible even if you know the target
    - [Spec PR #337](https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-spec/issues/337)
        - Declarative credential scoping
        - Builds on extensions work done by Simon and Silvin
        - Can add this as non-core spec
        - Carolyn: Is idea that bundle says these are the credentials the bundle needs and that the expectation is that the runtime creates user/service config with these?
            - Jacob: Idea is to pass admin credentials and have them down privileged
                - Unfortunately this isn't practically easy to do
        - Carolyn: Where would the code that does this live, CNAB Go?
            - Matt: This would be non-normative so could be implemented in an external tool
            - Jacob: For CNAB Go, we could have an interface for multiple credential providers and that spits out credential sets
            - Carolyn: Wondering how portable bundles like this would be
                - Jacob: Goal is to have something portable and avoid having bundles only be able to be installed by one tool
                - Carolyn: Tool that understands this extension has better security, naive tool still works
    - [Spec PR #338](https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-spec/issues/338)
        - Declarative installers for Kubernetes
    - Radu: Feels like using OCI manifests to share Kubernetes YAML has suddenly come up
        - Not sure that CNAB is the right place to solve this
        - Jacob: Don't have this use case but wanted to show that it could be done
        - Matt: Need to work out if this is an issue impacting enough users
- [CNAB Go #188](https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-go/pull/188)
    - Validate schema offline
    - Schemas currently live online (cnab.io/), we currently fetch the schema to do validation
    - This doesn't work for airgapped scenarios
    - Docker has done this in docker/cli for Compose
    - Radu doesn't want to copy paste the schema in a Go file
    - Bin packer? gobuffalo/packr
    - Jacob: Would be good to embed schemas for their parameters
        - Radu: We could bundle the schema in thick bundles
            - Matt: Means we'd be asking bundle if it's valid
- #285 meeting?
    - ~Glyn~ Ralph/Chris is going to plan this
    - Will aim to do something morning time Pacific
- Microsoft are using CNAB and have made some blog posts about them
